// FIXME: Currently the only way to use the mockito
// inject mock mechanism to test the CDI
// part is to run the test as JUnit tests
// since there is no mechanism to run this
// as a scala test.
// ScalaMock could be an option once the 
// issue https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/issues/100
// is resolved
